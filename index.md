Hello! I'm an emerging data analyst with roots in the field of psychological research.

I originally planned to become a researcher studying cognitive and affective psychology, and I hold a B.S. and M.A. in psychology. As a Master's student, I got the chance to collect, analyze, and present my own data for my thesis project, and I learned to write code in R and utlize various statistical tools to analyze data. I realized how much I love asking and answering questions and solving problems with data. I've been hooked on data analytics ever since. 

In the years following the completion of my M.A., I've sought out several opportunities to further develop my data analytic and coding skills. I worked as a research assistant to automate data cleaning processes and a teaching assistant to teach undergraduate students how to apply basic statistics to analyze research data; I developed a highly successful, twelve-part guest lecture series to teach graduate students how to analyze data in R; and I consulted for a hospitality business. Through all these experiences, I not only honed my technical skills, but also my ability to communicate complex information accurately and simply to non-technical audiences (like students!). 

More recently, I taught myself how to use other industry tools such as Python and SQL, and I just completed my Google Data Analytics Certificate, through which I've developed my business accumen and learned to use Tableau. I'm so excited to continue to grow and address thrilling new questions as I enter the field of data analytics.

I've created this website to share some of my personal projects. Please take a look around and reach out if you'd like to connect!
